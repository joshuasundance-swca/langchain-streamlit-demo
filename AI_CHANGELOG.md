Fri Sep 29 18:19:58 2023 -0400
- This commit includes a change in the variable name from 'input' to 'context' in both app.py and qagen.py files. The change was made in the section where the document page content is being processed. This change is likely aimed at improving code readability and consistency.
## [Added customizability for number of chunks in retriever](https://github.com/joshuasundance-swca/langchain-streamlit-demo/commit/457889e5dc68143a1a5f935ca6af849bd380666c)
Fri Sep 29 18:16:51 2023 -0400
- This commit introduces a slider in the UI allowing the user to select the number of chunks that will be used for context in the retriever. The 'get_texts_and_retriever' function was updated to include a new parameter 'k' that defaults to the newly introduced constant 'DEFAULT_RETRIEVER_K'. This 'k' value is then used in the creation of both the 'bm25_retriever' and 'faiss_retriever'.
## [Updated Q&A Generation method and invocation](https://github.com/joshuasundance-swca/langchain-streamlit-demo/commit/8aab446c1cbafbdb04dcf6d56ed77413f1e63f65)

- Replaced the get_qa_gen_chain method with get_rag_qa_gen_chain in app.py and qagen.py. This change updates the Q&A Generation method used in the Document Chat feature.
- Changed the way the Q&A Generation method is invoked. Instead of using the batch method, we now use the invoke method. This change is expected to improve the efficiency of the Document Chat feature.
## [Implemented RAG-based Q&A Generation Chain](https://github.com/joshuasundance-swca/langchain-streamlit-demo/commit/6467ea59cd8b5eb4859d20c8f84152402833cb92)
Fri Sep 29 18:04:08 2023 -0400
- Added a new function 'get_rag_qa_gen_chain' in 'qagen.py' to set up a RAG-based Q&A generation chain using a retriever and a language model.
- Adjusted the 'app.py' to include a commented-out option to use the new RAG-based Q&A generation chain.
## [Bump version from 0.0.9 to 0.0.10](https://github.com/joshuasundance-swca/langchain-streamlit-demo/commit/bb29f017b57cd891d1f9ae86e212ec6c92b5aa43)

## [Added Summarization Feature to Streamlit App](https://github.com/joshuasundance-swca/langchain-streamlit-demo/commit/47c2ffc283d1e1754c1f64ab5fb793694bc9f24f)
Thu Sep 28 19:53:59 2023 -0400
- This commit introduces a summarization feature to the Streamlit application. It does so by creating a new 'summarize.py' file and integrating it into the 'app.py' file.
- In 'app.py', the 'LLMChain' import has been moved and the 'get_summarization_chain' function has been imported from 'summarize.py'.
- A new option 'Summarization' has been added to the 'Document Chat Chain Type' dropdown menu.
- When 'Summarization' is selected from the dropdown, the 'get_summarization_chain' function is called to create a summarization chain.
- The summarization chain is then used to generate a summary of the document, which is displayed in the Streamlit app.
- In the 'summarize.py' file, a new summarization chain is defined using the 'load_summarize_chain' function from the 'langchain.chains.summarize' module. The chain uses two custom prompt templates for summarizing and refining the document text.
